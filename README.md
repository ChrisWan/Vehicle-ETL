# Vehicle-ETL
In this project, I took a lot on the whole ETL process. First we set delimiter and data types through excel, then we use Visual Studio to model the pipeline and finally import everything into a database via SQL Management. Next step was to create a working table based on the raw table with the right data types and formatting.
